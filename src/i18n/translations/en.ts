      {
        question: "Who is this program for?",
        answer: "The program is designed for busy people with a main job or tight schedule who are ready to learn using AI tools to create apps and bring their ideas to life, rather than just passively watching lessons.\n\nYou need to be ready to create a real product that you want to develop and be willing to work a little every day."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difficulty level of this program?",
        answer: "This program is designed for beginners. We provide step-by-step guidance and support to help you develop skills from scratch. No programming experience required - we use exclusively AI tools."
      },
      {
        question: "What tools or subscriptions will I need for the bootcamp?",
        answer: "• A working computer or laptop\n• Lovable Pro Plan ($25/month) - The main tool for creating the app. While there's a free version, we strongly recommend the Pro plan for a full-featured app in 14 days.\n• Supabase - Free for up to 2 projects, which is usually enough to launch your app without additional costs.\n• ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro - For advanced AI capabilities ($20/month)\n\nNote: We'll also suggest several additional tools to simplify development. Most have generous free plans, so you won't have to spend much beyond the basic subscriptions."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need programming experience?",
        answer: "Absolutely not! The entire bootcamp is built on using AI tools. You'll learn to \"talk\" to AI to create apps without writing a single line of code. This is a revolutionary approach that makes app development accessible to everyone."
      },
      {
        question: "How much time do I need to dedicate each day?",
        answer: "The program is designed for busy people. 1-2 hours per day is sufficient to complete the material and work on your project. Lessons can be taken at your own pace, but consistency is key to success."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I get stuck or have questions?",
        answer: "You will have access to:\n• Weekly live sessions with the instructor for Q&A\n• A private participant group for mutual support\n• Direct access to the instructor through the platform\n• A library of ready-made solutions for common problems"
      },
      {
        question: "Do you guarantee results?",
        answer: "If you complete all lessons and assignments but don't create a working app, we'll refund 100% of the cost. Our methodology is proven - over 200 students have already created their first apps."
